## Problem Statement

Managing projects often means juggling scattered data, complex reports, and inconsistent tracking methods. This makes it hard for teams to get a clear view of progress, costs, and overall performance.

This Project Management Power BI Dashboard solves this by bringing all project information together in one interactive space. It lets organizations easily track total projects, costs, benefits, and the benefit–cost ratio, while also breaking down insights by region, department, month, status, and phase using visual tools like line charts, bar charts, cards, doughnut charts, and column charts.

With dedicated pages for project summaries, detailed timelines, and interactive tables, this dashboard makes it simple to spot completed, on-hold, or canceled projects at a glance. Custom navigation icons, clean visuals, and dynamic date tracking enhance the experience, while Power Query transformations and DAX formulas ensure the data is accurate and reliable.

By turning complex data into clear, actionable insights, this dashboard help decision-makers to reduce inefficiencies, keep projects on track, and focus on achieving real results.
